Open Source Crytpo trading tools and bots in python
This is a desktop python application; the trading API keys are not saved to the computer and never leaves it.
Trailer stop loss takes the following input,
•	ordertype = Select s for sell or b for buy
•	trailer stop = Enter trailer stop value, this value will be continuously subtracted or added to the last price based on the order type.
•	stoploss = Stop loss value, the stop loss value in the other direction of the trade.
•	orderdelta = Enter margin price for placing orders, ie. the delta from the last price, this value will be used as the rate for placing orders when criteria matches.
•	quantity = Order Quantity
•	key = API Key
•	secret = API Secret


I'm using Thonny IDE to run the python files.

# **crypbots**
##**Open Source Crytpo trading tools and bots in python**

This is a desktop python application; the trading API keys are not saved to the computer and never leaves it.  
I'm using Thonny IDE to run the python files.  
Refer to the [backlog](https://github.com/cryptoboogy/crypbots/blob/master/backlog.xlsx) for the roadmap.  
Please use the [user manual](https://github.com/cryptoboogy/crypbots/blob/master/User%20manual.docx) for testing and trials.
